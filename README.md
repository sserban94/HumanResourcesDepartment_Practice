This is a Human Resources Management System - C# Winforms Project
The user can add data about an employee such as - name, birth date, wage and optionally the department. Everything is validated here so that the user can't crash the app.
The data(details about each employee) is shown in a DataGridView. Here in the main form, the user can add, delete, edit employees, check if every employee is in a department or not (with the help of a bool overloaded operator) and sort them by their names in ascending order and descending by their birth date via buttons in a Context Menu Strip with the help of the ICompararer interface which compares two instances of the employee class. The main form automatically loades data from a db file when it starts and also saves everything in the same db file when closing. The data can also be imported/exported from/to a XML file via buttons in a Tool Strip.
